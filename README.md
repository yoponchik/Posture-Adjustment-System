_An eye tracking cushion system that adjusts postures._

----------
<h2>Project Details</h2>

**Project Date:** 2021.01 - 2021.02

**Project Objective:** A inflation bag for blood pressure machine was used as a neck cushion. When bad posture is detected, the cushion is inflated, thus repositioning the neck. 

**Dev Tools:** Arduino, OpenCV, Dlib

**Programming Language:** Python

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

Of all the problems that I could think of, bad posture was something that I could relate to the most and that I wanted to fix. Consequently, I thought a smart posture adjustment cushion would be the best solution. **Or at least better than an electric shocker.** 

I looked around the house for spare parts and ended up hacking up a blood pressure machine into this magnificent... invention.

- Finalized the circuitry for the Arduino board.
- Used a plastic bottle to show inflation.

- Finalized code for the eye tracking system. When the eyes go under the green line, the system detects a bad posture and activates the motor.
